## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) is to define the processes, standards, and activities required to ensure that the software products meet the quality objectives of **Faubridge Enterprise Holdings**. This plan applies specifically to the **Faubridge CoreOps** software suite, which is designed to manage the internal operations of FE's corporate offices, including HR management, financial reporting, and IT support systems.

### 1.1 Scope:
This SQAP covers all phases of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), including:
- Requirements gathering and documentation
- Design and development
- Testing (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing)
- Deployment and maintenance

The plan ensures that the software meets the needs of the corporate office users and operates reliably in a high-availability environment, meeting security and performance standards as outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
